                                    <li>We provide Services via the Website to assist Users (“ Buyers”) seeking
                                    to purchase quality sneakers and street wears and associated products
                                    (collectively, the “Products”).</li>

                                    “Sellers”) of Products to advertise and offer their Products for sale to
                                    Buyers via the Website’s interface.</li>
                                    <li>The Website further allows Buyers to research, search or shop for,

                                    Website, Hypex merely promotes and advertises Products for sale,
                                    serves as a point of contact between Sellers and Buyers, facilitates the
                                    exchange of information between Sellers and Buyers, assist Buyers in

                                <p>Both parties agree that browsing the website and gathering information
regarding the services provided by the seller does not constitute an offer to
sell, but merely an invitation to treat. The parties accept that an offer is only
made once you have selected the item you intend to purchase, chosen your
preferred payment method, proceeded to the checkout and completed the
checkout process.<br />
Both parties agree that the acceptance of the offer is not made when the seller
contacts you by phone or by email to confirm that the order has been placed
online. Your offer is only accepted when we dispatch the product to you and
inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered
product. Before your order is confirmed, you may be asked to provide
additional verifications or information, including but not limited to phone
number and address, before we accept the order.<br />

various reasons. The Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for
any reason at any given time.

we are unable to provide the services, we will inform you of this as soon as
possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the
products.</p>

                                used items will not be exchanged nor will a refund be made.<br />
                                If returning items in an order where the initial order qualified for a free gift the
                                free gift must be returned in an unused condition too. Any items returned
                                without the qualifying free gift will not be refunded.</p>

                                <h2>DELIVERY</h2>
                                <p>You will receive an email or phone call a day after your order has been sent
containing the parcel number and a link to receive the parcel.<br />
Items must be signed for as they cannot be left unattended. It is your
obligation to enter the correct delivery address details at the time of ordering.
Should you enter a wrong address, we are not obliged to re-send the order to
the correct address at our expense.<br />
It is the responsibility of the customer to inform us if an order does not arrive.
Once we learn an order has not arrived, we will lodge enquiries with our
delivery partners to ensure delivery occurs as soon as possible. We will not be
held liable for any loss or damage resulting from late delivery.<br />
Please note that if an item has been lost in transit, we will not despatch a
replacement item until we have resolved the problem. Replacement items will
be dispatched according to our discretion.</p>
<p>
We make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales set out
on our Site; however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen
factors. We shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the
products within the estimated timescales where they did not occur due to our
fault or negligence.</p><p>
You agree not to hold the seller liable for any delay or failure to deliver
products or otherwise perform any obligation as specified in these Terms and
Conditions of Sale if the same is wholly or partly caused whether directly or
indirectly by circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
Without limiting the operation of any other Terms and Conditions herein, we
will not accept liability for any loss or damage arising from a late delivery.
</p>


<h2>BUYER OBLIGATION</h2>
<p>
As a buyer, you are obligated to pay for any items you order. To be an eligible
buyer you must have a billing address and shipping address within one of the
countries that Hypex supports. If your address is outside the Canada, then
you will be responsible for picking up your package and for paying all
customs, duties, taxes and any other related fees in addition to the
international shipping charges; you will be solely responsible for compliance
with all customs requirements on import; and, when placing your order, you
authorize us to appoint an agent to file the customs declarations on your
behalf. In general, we charge your credit card immediately upon purchase and
hold the funds in escrow until the transaction is complete, at which time we
pay the seller. You will not receive any interest on the escrowed amount. You
might be required to pay certain fees as described when placing your Buy
Order, as updated from time to time. If your payment fails or is rejected for any
reason (e.g., purchase exceeds credit card limit, card is cancelled,
chargeback is requested), Hypex reserves the right to do any or all of the
following, in its sole discretion:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>charge buyer’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the
transaction amount;</li>
    <li>cancel any or all of buyer’s orders pending through the Services;</li>
    <li>withhold refunds or payments due to buyer;</li>
    <li>place limits on buyer’s buying and selling privileges;</li>
    <li>charge buyer’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by
Hypex as a result of buyer’s action or inaction; and</li>
    <li>temporarily or permanently suspend buyer’s account. All sales are final
once the item is authenticated and delivered, and no refund requests
will be honored regardless of the current value of the item. If you
experience a problem with your purchase or an item, please contact us
at info@hypex.ca. If there is a problem with an item you received, you
must contact us in writing within 3 days after receiving the item with a
detailed description of the problem.  Hypex verification tags or stickers
that are attached to items must not be removed, or the items will not be
eligible for return or exchange under any circumstance (including
damage in transit).</li>
    
</ul>


<h2>SELLER OBLIGATIONS</h2>
<p>By listing an item for sale, you are making a binding offer to sell that specific
item to a buyer who purchases the item for the Ask price you have specified
and to ship the item. When a buyer accepts your offer by purchasing your
item through our Services, you are contractually and legally bound to deliver
that exact item for the specified price. Sellers must ship items via the shipping
carrier designated by Hypex within the specified timeframe provided in the
sale confirmation email and must obtain a receipt from the shipping carrier to
verify shipment of item. Hypex will provide you with a shipping label with such
carrier after your Ask is matched by a buyer. You are obligated to monitor
your inventory and ensure all listings are accurate. Once an order and Ask
are matched, under no circumstances may a seller cancel the listing. Failure
to fulfill your orders will result in additional charges to you, including an
additional charge equal to 15% of the transaction amount. If a seller fails to
deliver items to Hypex in accordance with these Terms, Hypex reserves the
right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion:</p>

<ul>
    

<li>charge seller’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the
transaction amount as a service fee;</li>
<li> remove any or all of seller’s listings from the Services;</li>
<li> cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending through the Services;</li>
<li> withhold any payments due to seller;</li>
<li> place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges;</li>
<li> charge seller’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by
Hypex as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging seller
for the cost of a replacement, coupons and gift certificates provided to
the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by Hypex, rerouting charges
imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer; and</li>
<li> temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s account.</li> 

</ul>



    <p>As a seller, you are required to ensure that the item you are listing exactly
matches the image on the New Ask page. If Hypex or a buyer reasonably
determines that your item does not conform to the description (including,
without limitation, meeting the applicable Condition Standard), or is
counterfeit, then we will charge your credit card an amount equal to 15% of
the transaction amount as a service fee, plus additional amounts or, as
determined in Hypex’s discretion, charging you for the cost of a replacement,
coupons and gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by
Hypex, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer.<br />
Hypex has no obligation to return items that do not conform to the description
(including, without limitation, meeting the applicable Condition Standard), or
are counterfeit (in which case, Hypex may turn those items over to the proper
authorities) at your cost. Hypex will pay you within thirty (30) days after the
sale is complete, which occurs when the buyer receives the item. To get paid
more quickly, ship your items immediately after your Ask is matched by a
buyer.</p>

</ul>

<p>Hypex reserves the right to take whatever lawful actions it may deem
appropriate in response to actual or suspected violations of these Terms,
including, without limitation, the suspension or termination of your access
and/or account. Hypex may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third
parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong.
Except as may be expressly limited by the Privacy Policy or applicable law,
Hypex reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as Hypex
deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information
or materials, in whole or in part, in Hypex’s sole discretion. You also agree to
reimburse Hypex for any damage, loss, cost or expense Hypex incurs
(including fees or costs of attorneys, accountants, professional advisors, and
other experts incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of the

foregoing) because of your use of the Services for any unlawful or prohibited
purpose.</p>

<h2>AUTHENTICATION; SHIPPING AND HANDLING</h2>
<p>As part of the purchase transaction, the seller will ship the item to Hypex and
Hypex will visually inspect the item and use commercially reasonable efforts to
confirm it is authentic. If Hypex determines the item is authentic, Hypex will
ship the item to the buyer. If Hypex cannot reasonably confirm the authenticity
of the item or determines it is not authentic, then we will notify the buyer and
the seller that the item is not authentic and will issue a refund to the buyer.
Additionally, Hypex has the right to reject any item for any reason, including
but not limited to, authenticity or damage of the item. Hypex policy requires
sellers to ship items within the specified timeframe provided in the sale
confirmation email after purchase. However, because Hypex cannot control
the amount of time it takes for the item to reach Hypex, we cannot guarantee
a specific delivery timeframe for any items and therefore, buyer is not
permitted to cancel the purchase if the item does not ship from the seller
within the specified timeframe in the sale confirmation email after purchase.
Once we receive the item from the seller it generally takes 1-2 business days
for us to authenticate the item and ship it to a buyer. If a buyer does not
receive an item, the buyer shall promptly report the issue to Hypex within 2
days of the latest estimated delivery date. Hypex has the right, in our sole and
absolute discretion to refuse to accept returns or other refunds and/or to
charge restocking fees for returned or abandoned items.</p>

<h2>COUNTERFEITS, FRAUD, AND MARKET MANIPULATION</h2>
<p>Hypex takes counterfeiting, fraud and market manipulation very seriously. If a
seller provides a counterfeit item or attempts to defraud any buyer or Hypex,
Hypex reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion:</p>

<ul>
    <li>remove any or all of seller’s listings from the Services;</li>

<li>cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending through the Services;</li>

<li> withhold any payments due to seller;</li>
<li> place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges;</li>
<li>charge seller’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by
Hypex as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging
seller for the cost of replacement items, the value of coupons and gift
certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by Hypex,
rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer;</li>

<li> ship the item back to the seller at the seller’s cost;</li>
<li>provide the counterfeit items to law enforcement or destroy the
counterfeit items,</li>
<li> temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s account, and</li>
<li> charge Seller’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the
transaction amount as a service fee.</li>

</ul>

<p>Seller hereby agrees that each of the foregoing remedies are reasonable and
justified upon Hypex’s discovery of counterfeit items or fraudulent actions,
even if those items or actions were not known by the Seller at the time to be
counterfeit or fraudulent (e.g., negligent fraud). Seller understands and agrees
that if we provide the counterfeit item to law enforcement, seller’s
communications and any property claim with respect to that item must be
solely with that law enforcement agency and not with us. We may also use
fraud protection measures, including algorithms and automated systems to
monitor for fraud, which might result in cancellation of listings or sales or
account suspension. If this occurs in error please contact us at
<a href="mailto:info@hypex.ca">info@hypex.ca</a>. We may also require additional identification information from
you if you engage in certain high-value transactions or high overall payment
volumes through Hypex.</p>

<p>If a buyer receives an item that it believes to be counterfeit, the buyer must
notify Hypex in writing within 3 days after receiving the item, and we will
commence an investigation into the item. The buyer shall cooperate with us in
the investigation and final disposition of the item, including providing
photographs and other evidence of the item, providing the item to law
enforcement, destroying the item, or delivering the item back to us, at our
direction. If we elect to have the buyer destroy the item, the buyer shall
provide reasonable proof of destruction to us. We will refund all fees and costs
paid by the buyer for the item (including shipping and handling). In no event
may a buyer resell any item (on Hypex or elsewhere) that is reasonably
believed to be counterfeit.</p>
<p>Hypex may monitor the integrity of the Hypex marketplace and may take steps
to protect the marketplace as determined by Hypex in its sole discretion (e.g.,
if Hypex believes a seller or buyer is engaging in market manipulation or
fraud, including creating false or “dummy” accounts). If Hypex believes that a
seller or buyer attempts to interfere with the free and fair operation of the
Hypex marketplace, or creates artificial, false or misleading information, or
information appearing to mislead with respect to pricing or demand for a
product on the Hypex marketplace (all of the foregoing in Hypex’s sole
discretion), then, without limiting any other rights of Hypex, Hypex reserves
the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion:</p>

<ul>
    <li>remove any or all of the user’s listings from the Services;</li>
<li> cancel any or all of the user’s orders pending through the Services;</li>
<li> withhold any payments due to the user;</li>
<li> place limits on a user’s buying and selling privileges;</li>
<li> charge user’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by
Hypex as a result of the user’s actions;</li>
<li> notify law enforcement of the fraudulent activity;</li>
<li> temporarily or permanently suspend the user’s account .</li>

</ul>
