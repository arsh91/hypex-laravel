                                <h2>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING MECHANISMS</h2>
                                <p>We or our services providers may also collect data about your use of the
                                Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies, JavaScript, tracking
                                pixels, and/or other technologies. A web server log is a file where website

                                <h2>NOTICE CONCERNING DO-NOT-TRACK SIGNALS</h2>
                                <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
                                browsers. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals,
                                as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what
                                DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to
                                responding to DNT.</p>

                                <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
                                <p>We use secure payment partner for processing payments. We and our
                                payment gateway partners do not store your card data on their servers. The
                                data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                                (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only
                                used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that
                                is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.</p>br>
                                Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
                                by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like
                                Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.<br />
                                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
                                information by our store and its service providers.</p>

                                <p>UPDATING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
                                We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally
                                Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change any of
                                your Personally Identifiable Information in your account online at any time by

                                We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information
                                if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or
                                removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot
                                delete information associated with past transactions on this site. In addition, it
                                may be impossible to completely delete your information without some
                                residual information because of backups.</p>

                                    However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where
                                    we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to
                                    perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate
                                    interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental

                                    relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal
                                    information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if
                                    you do not provide your personal information).</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our
                                    legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at

                                    are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. Hypex may
                                    discipline or terminate individuals who maliciously acquire information, without

                                    <p> Once client information is no longer needed, Hypex will take reasonable steps
                                    to destroy or de-identify the information as long as Hypex is not required by
                                    applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                                    <p> We will take seriously and deal promptly with any accidental or unauthorised
                                    disclosure of personal information. We follow the relevant scheme for
                                    notifiable data breaches where applicable and when handling accidental or
                                    unauthorised disclosures of personal information.</p>

                                    purchase from a third-party site that links to or from the Website, since these

                                    necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or off-line
                                    transaction with any of these third parties.</p>

                                    transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given
                                    you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access the
                                    Hypex website and or certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping
                                    this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with
                                    anyone.</p>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not

                                    <p>By using Hypex you agree that we may collect, store, transfer and process

                                    <p>We do not use or disclose your personal data for direct marketing purposes
                                    unless we obtained your consent, such as through an opt-in or opt-out tick box

                                    <h2>DATA SECURITY POLICY</h2>
                                    <p>The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information
                                    associated with visitors to the Website—as well as Hypex customer
                                    information, such as cell phone numbers, texts, messages, credit card
                                    information, addresses, and other account data—is of utmost concern to
                                    Hypex.com, and we have implemented, and periodically review, certain
                                    physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help prevent unauthorized
                                    access and maintain data security. Your payment and personal information is
                                    always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry
                                    standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce
                                    transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card
                                    number, name, and address. Unfortunately, due to the open nature of Internet
                                    communications, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
                                    be secure, and thus we cannot guarantee that communications between you
                                    and Hypex will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Visitors of
                                    the Website and Hypex customers use the Website at their own risk.</p>
